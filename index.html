<h1 style="font-weight: bold">My 1st Nginx Page - Created by Bash Scripting</h1>
<p>
	This was created by a local workstation script file which:
</p>
<ol>
	<li> - SSH'd into the remote machine
	<li> - Set safety options in the bash environment
	<li> - Installed Nginx
	<li> - scp secured copied an already built index.html file into the directory Nginx serves templates from, i.e. /var/www/html/...
	<li> - rebooted Nginx so that it would serve the index.html file 
</ol>
